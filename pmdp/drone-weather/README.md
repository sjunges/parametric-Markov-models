Drone flying in different weather conditions
--------------------------------------------

This benchmark describes a gridworld drone flying through a valley, where
movement is affected stochastically by weather conditions. The parameters
describe the weather conditions. The paper [1] uses this as an example for
uncontrollable parameters which themselves can be governed by a
distribution.
